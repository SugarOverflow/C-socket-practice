# C-socket-practice

Modified c-code in order to implement a simple client-server interaction
Some commented functions for modelling what was supposed to be a login server for another project.

Code is semi-working and still incomplete, but was an interesting experience. 
Reminded me a little of Processing's Javascript client-server code in OpenCV.

Test files were compiled via g++ in a ubuntu terminal.
